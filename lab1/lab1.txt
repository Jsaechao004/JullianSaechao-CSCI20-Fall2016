My name is Jullian Saechao.
I am currently majoring Computer Science.
I am in this class because i am interest in learning more about programming and developing my imaginations.
I think i will learn more programming techniques
Since this will be public, i would like to get to know more of my classmates, i am a quiet and shy kind of a person, but if i get to know you more, then i will talk more.
